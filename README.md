# Mouse Clicker

This is a Python script for automating mouse clicks on a set of user-defined positions. When the user clicks on the screen, the program records the position and saves it to a list. The user can then activate the automation mode by pressing the Shift key. The program will then click on each position in the list in sequence with a specified duration between clicks. The automation can be paused/resumed by pressing the Shift key again. The program can be terminated by pressing the Esc key.


## 

The program can be useful for automating repetitive clicking tasks, such as web scraping or game playing.
